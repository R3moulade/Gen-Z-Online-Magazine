        <h1>Why is Gen Z humor so strange?</h1>
        <h2>Subheading</h2>
        <p id="author">By Maddie Hansen, 2021</p>
        <p>
            <span>Generation Z (1995~2010)</span> , not to be confused with Millenials, whom are born between 1981 and 1994. Millennials' internet humor consists of ye good olden classics, such as [Velociraptor] and rage comics. So how does Gen Z’s humor differ from that of the previous generation? For that answer, we have to first look at Gen Z’s [background]. They were raised during the revolution of phones, tablets and computers, all whom have direct access to the internet and all of its wonders and… not-so-wonders. This accessibility, coupled with a hearty breakfast of free time, became one of the primary influences on Gen Z humor.
        </p>
        <h2>Oversaturation</h2>
        <p>Imagine getting a joke told by a friend over and over again. It might be funny the first time, maybe even the second time, but maybe not a third time. This is what has happened for Gen Z, as jokes have been copied and pasted with small variants and combinations. These are what we call <span>"Template memes"</span>.
            They are consumed en masse, which is why internet trends seem to come and go as fast as [insert more original euphemism than “the wind”]. Over time they typically become more complex, to a point where you need more context and knowledge of current and 
            previous memes to fully understand the message it’s trying to convey. </p>
           
            <p>
            Now, imagine your friend lets the joke sit on a shelf for a good while, and then suddenly bring it back - and this time it’s funnier than the first time they told it. This is what we call <span>“Ironic humor”</span> in the Gen Z humor bible. This is similar to bad movies, in which we relish in the experience of mocking and [pretending to enjoy it], and can really be translated to all types of media. Another form of ironic humor is the embodiment of [un-understandableness] in and of itself is the punchline. Take for example this meme. For context, this meme stems from the toxicity of elitism, that should you like something, you have to know every aspect of the subject. The top and bottom text of the meme has no correlation, and therefore the expectation of elitist ideals shatters and becomes <span>absurd</span> as well as <span>meaningless in an ironic matter</span>.
        </p>
           
            <h2>If I’ve seen it before, so it’s not cool</h2>
            <p>As said before, the Gen Z humor thrives on the <span>fluctuation of trends</span>. This generation has the whole wide world in its hands - whether it be unlimited streaming of music, videos, information, games, shopping - you name it! In a world where you can pick and choose whatever content you want, <span>uniqueness</span> is very much appreciated. Therefore, <span>mainstream content</span> is greatly despised. Take Fortnite, for example. It started out as a very beloved game, but soon got ruined by it becoming trendy and well-known across the world. It also became a target for marketing, which made it so untouchable, that you couldn’t even enjoy it ironically. This has also happened to many memes, case in point this image. Furthermore, as stated before, if the meme has already been seen on the internet one too many times, it’s uncool (and will become undead if revived again some time later), so if you share a meme that’s already run its course (which can be as short as a few days), you basically suck.
                So, if any type of content dies as soon as it sees the light of day, <span>how can any humor exist?</span> As soon as a style is invented, it becomes invalid, which makes Gen Z constantly have to adapt to new humor.</p>
            
                <h2>[Beans]</h2>
            <p>This is where <span>randomness</span> and <span>ironic quirkiness</span> comes into play. If it’s hard to keep up with trends that become invalid the minute you get your hands on it, then why not add an element to it that cannot have a style? If we take the Gru meme into consideration again, we can see it has a bit of randomness to it. </p></p>
